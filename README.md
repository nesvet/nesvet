## Hey 👋

Solo dev from Tbilisi 🇬🇪 building [flatr](https://github.com/nesvet/flatr) — because uploading 50 files to ChatGPT one by one is nobody's idea of fun.

```bash
npx flatr . -o codebase.md
```

Flattens your entire codebase into one AI-ready file. Works with Claude, Gemini, GPT, Cursor, whatever.

**Just launched.** If you try it:
- Let me know what breaks (seriously, break it please 🐛)
- Star it if it saves you time ⭐
- Or just say hi: [github@nesvet.dev](mailto:github@nesvet.dev)
